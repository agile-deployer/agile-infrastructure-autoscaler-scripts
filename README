These scripts are responsible for spawning new webservers based on demand configuration set by the deployer.
To alter the number of webservers which are deployed, modify the

NO_WEBSERVERS variable in ${HOME}/autoscaler/PerformScaling.sh

If you do a "production" deployment, you will also find a scale up and scale down script in the crontab which you can modify
to reflect your needs in terms of time to scale up and time to scale down and how many webservers in each case. 

In effect this system doesn't "autoscale" although it could be extended to but it does "scale".
The deployer is resonsible for defining the scaling profile using the scale up and scale down scripts and also,
by modifying the NO_WEBSERVERS parameter in the PerformScaling script. 

**NOTE** 
If you are deploying for "Development", then remember that auto-scaling or scaling is switched off. 
If you want to switch into Production mode (with autoscaling or scaling), the best thing to do is to rebuild. 
Although you could manually alter things to switch tfrom development to production, it is not recommended.
